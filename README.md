## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a senior at Washington and Lee University majoring in Integrated Engineering with Computer Science. I am currently taking CSCI 209: Software Development to expand on my knowledge of Java and efficient software. Outside of school, I enjoy playing lacrosse, spending time with friends, and going to the beach.
